# Seniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal 

Dates 7/20-7/31

**My Name:**
Raymond Wu

**Project Name:** 
Hubble.gl integration into Kepler.gl

**Is your project New or Old?**
Old

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Team

## Description
Allow Kepler.gl users to export their data visualizations to a movie with defined camera movements (pans, zooms, etc.)

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
Currently a MVP has been done that allows the user to export their data visualization as a movie. However, this is in a separate PoC repo and does not connect to Kepler in any form


## Objective 1: say your objective here, you must have at least three objectives to get credit for the intensive… accomplishing objective should be done by soley you
Figure out where the Redux store for Kepler lives

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
This is the first step in being able to build an export feature as I need to pass all of the props to our export component. In addition, being able to find this will have meant that I was able to successfully navigate a large codebase.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
I have a master component where the props will be abstracted away for ease of development

## Objective 2: ... say your objective to accomplish here …
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
Create a modal component for the export feature to live

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
There will be an export button in Kepler that will lead to the modal

## Objective 3: ... say your objective to accomplish here …
**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
Flesh out the features of said modal. Camera pans, tilts, and even overlays for the movie

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
These features will be shown on the modal.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**
