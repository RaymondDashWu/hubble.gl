# Seniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal 

Dates 7/20-7/31

**My Name:**
Raymond Wu

**Project Name:** 
Hubble.gl integration into Kepler.gl

**Is your project New or Old?**
Old

**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Team

## Description
Allow Kepler.gl users to export their data visualizations to a movie with defined camera movements (pans, zooms, etc.)

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**
Currently a MVP has been done that allows the user to export their data visualization as a movie. However, this is in a separate PoC repo and does not connect to Kepler in any form


## Objective 1: Figure out where the Redux store for Kepler lives


**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
This is the first step in being able to build an export feature as I need to pass all of the props to our export component. In addition, being able to find this will have meant that I was able to successfully navigate a large codebase.

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
I have a master component where the props will be abstracted away for ease of development

## Objective 2: Create a modal component for the export feature to live

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
This is the main encapsulation of where all the components and states will lay. It's important because it organizes all our work into one master component and will make future updating easier

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
There will be an export button in Kepler that will lead to the modal

## Objective 3: Flesh out the features of said modal. Camera pans, tilts, and even overlays for the movie

**Why do you want to meet this objective? How will it improve your project?** 
This objective should be met because otherwise there's no difference in making this feature and screen recording. It'll make a small but meaningful impact on the user's experience

**How will you demonstrate completion of your objective?** 
These features will be shown on the modal.

## Stretch goals (optional):

**What stretch goals do you have for your project?**
